# orb_01_talos_queries

This clone/pull data from https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/osquery_queries and attempts to create Cisco Orbital quersies for each folder that is named in the api.cfg file.

Modify the api.cfg file with your Cisco Orbital Client ID, Secret, and nodes to execute against (if you want to restrict from running against all os systems).
